/**
 * Shared machinery for the WCAG gate.
 *
 * Three rules govern everything here:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING IS INJECTED INTO THE PAGE BEFORE A SCAN. The version of this gate
 *     this file replaces force-opened every <details>, stripped `[hidden]` and
 *     inline `display:none` off every element, and — worse — measured "gradient
 *     contrast" by reading `--bg`/`--text` off two synthetic divs, a ratio
 *     independent of anything the page actually painted that returned a passing
 *     5.0 default whenever the node was missing. Every interesting rendering on
 *     this page (a broken comparison column, a recovered-key hex box, an
 *     accepted forgery, the implementation-note <details>, a live guided-tour
 *     step) is reachable by driving the page, and this gate reaches them that
 *     way instead. Motion is settled honestly (see `settle`) rather than frozen,
 *     and the composite-aware arithmetic in contrast.ts measures the colours the
 *     page actually paints, at the opacity it actually paints them.
 *
 *  2. EVERY SCAN ASSERTS ITS CONTENT IS PRESENT FIRST, and there are scans well
 *     past first paint. axe over an empty container passes having checked
 *     nothing. The whole lab is injected by JS into an empty `#app`, and its
 *     most interesting renderings — the recovered session key, the accepted
 *     hybrid forgery, the per-column anatomy checklist, the filled timing
 *     tiles — are all downstream of a click.
 *
 *  3. `violations` IS NOT THE WHOLE ORACLE. See `scan`.

 * Wait for every running animation and transition to drain.
 *
 * Transitions drain in waves, not in one batch, so a poll for "nothing running
 * right now" can exit through a gap between waves. Require quiescence to hold
 * for several consecutive frames instead. On this page the things in motion are
 * the guided-tour `.cl-highlight` box-shadow pulse, the byte-bar `width`
 * transition and the switch-thumb slide — all short, but a scan must not race
 * the pulse.
 *
 * The 20s ceiling is deliberately generous rather than tight: on a loaded
 * machine the raf cadence stretches, and the correct response to that is a
 * longer wait, never a narrower scan.
